# Webpack-in-React-Template
Webpack in react is a JavaScript module bundler that is commonly used with React to bundle and manage dependencies. It takes all of the individual JavaScript files and other assets in a project, such as images and CSS, and combines them into a single bundle that can be loaded by the browser.
